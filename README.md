# LED 3 Module with Arduino UNO: Simple Instructions

# Components Needed
- Arduino UNO
- 3 LED modules (or individual LEDs)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

# Instructions

1. **Connect the LEDs to the Breadboard:**
   - Insert one LED module into one side of the breadboard, and the other two LED modules into the opposite side.
   - Each LED module typically has a positive (anode) and negative (cathode) leg.
   - Ensure the positive leg of each LED module is connected to the same row on the breadboard, and the negative legs are connected to separate rows.

2. **Connect LEDs to Arduino:**
   - Connect the positive (anode) leg of the first LED module to pin 9 on the Arduino using a jumper wire.
   - Connect the positive (anode) leg of the second LED module to pin 10 on the Arduino using another jumper wire.
   - Connect the positive (anode) leg of the third LED module to pin 11 on the Arduino using another jumper wire.
   - Connect the negative (cathode) leg of all three LED modules to separate rows on the breadboard, and then connect each row to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino using jumper wires.

3. **Power the Arduino:**
   - Plug the Arduino into a USB port or power it with an external adapter.

4. **Observe the LED Modules:**
   - Once the Arduino is powered, all three LED modules should light up.
