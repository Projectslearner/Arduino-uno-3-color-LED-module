## 3 LED Module using Arduino UNO

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a 3-color LED module using an Arduino UNO. The LED module will cycle through red, green, and blue colors, creating a colorful lighting effect.

### Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO Board**
2. **3-Color LED Module**
3. **Resistors (220 ohms)**
4. **Breadboard**
5. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram


### Circuit Wiring

1. **LED Module:**
   - Connect the red LED pin to digital pin 11 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the green LED pin to digital pin 10 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the blue LED pin to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the common cathode (or anode, depending on your LED module) to the GND pin on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor for each LED color.

### Instructions

1. **Connect the LED and Resistors:**
   - Place the LED module on the breadboard.
   - Connect the red LED pin to digital pin 11 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the green LED pin to digital pin 10 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the blue LED pin to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the common cathode of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor for each LED.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Observe the LED Module:**
   - The LED module will cycle through red, green, and blue colors with a one-second delay between each color.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes the red, green, and blue LED pins as output.

- **LED Control:**
  - The LEDs cycle through red, green, and blue colors in sequence, creating a colorful lighting effect.

### Applications

- **Ambient Lighting:** Use the 3-color LED module to create ambient lighting in your projects or room.
- **Decoration:** Ideal for decorative lighting setups or creative displays.
- **Visual Indicators:** Can be used as visual indicators or notifications in various applications.
